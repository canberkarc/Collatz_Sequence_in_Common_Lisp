You will read at most 5 integers (File may contain fewer numbers) from a given file called
“integer_inputs.txt”. For each integer you will calculate the collatz sequence and print the results into a
file called “collatz_outputs.txt” as follows. For example, given integers 6, 8 and 17 your program should
have the output. You can find lots of reading material online about the collatz sequence.
